# Models
Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. Some popular types of models used in machine learning applications include the Linear Regression model and the Artificial Neural Networks.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response, called the dependent variable, and one or more explanatory variables, called the independent variables.

Given a data set $\{y_i,x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{ip}\} _ {i=1}^n$ of $n$ observations, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable $y$ and the $p$-vector of regressors $\boldsymbol{x}$ is linear.
